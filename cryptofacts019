# Facts About Crypto-currencies 2-7-019

note: this is not investment advice, but general information. Readers will need to make their own decisions regarding what and more importantly, when to purchase or sell/spend.

I wish there were a simple way to inform people about crypto-currencies so that they could make proper decisions, but there isn’t. Therefore, this document will have to be somewhat lengthy.  There is little doubt that cryptocurrencies are a massive piece of the future. Simultaneously, navigating the waters of crypto requires some skill and understanding.  Those who successfully navigate will end up with huge advantages.  Those who don’t will end up losing, either small or big.   I’m going to break this subject matter down into multiple issues so that a reader can get a serious understanding of the dynamic.  


### First, I am going to disspell some of the common FUD that has been used to attack cryptos since the beginning.  

1: It’s a pyramid/ponzi scheme!!!  Run Chicken little!!!!!
It’s crucial to understand that cryptos are not like any financial asset of the past. Therefore, it is easy to foolishly stamp them with words like pyramid, ponzi scheme, bubble, etc. that come from old economics models.  Truth is .. all of these words are partially correct, but none of them really sum up the nature of cryptocurrencies.  Most crypto-currencies are designed to reward the early adopters. Some were not designed that way.  Guess what?  So far, no cryptocurrency that doesn’t reward the early adopters has gotten anywhere far.  This is because every currency model has overhead costs, and for cryptos, those overhead costs are generally paid as rewards to early adopters. Coders, designers, promoters are also being rewarded for their efforts in the well designed cryptos.   They are also paid as rewards for miners/stakers and  possibly, people who run “nodes”.   The real question is:  will cryptos create more rewards than losses?  I am quite confident that the answer to that is yes. 

Crypto-currencies are like pyramid schemes in that early adopters have advantages.  Those early adopters also take risks.  Crypto-currencies are not like pyramid schemes in that there is actually no formal pyramid structure.  If someone makes money playing the game, that actually does not promise that anyone else in the system made any money.  Your performance on this market is primarily a function of your own ability to predict the market, or to function as a part of the system, and literally not much else.    

Cryptos are like a ponzi scheme in that they reward early adopters with money from later adopters. Cryptos are not like a ponzi scheme in that the systems are not pre-designed or pre-determined to collapse.  That does not imply that they won’t collapse.  While people complain of falling prices, cryptocurrencies have dominantly risen in price over their life times.  It is bad or inadequate investment sense that has resulted in losses. People who sold in the past would so far, many to most of them have done better to simply hold on and wait for prices to recover.   

As an early adopter, I have so far offered much more value of my time building and explaining the system to others than what I have yet been properly compensated for.  Imo, most of the assets spent for crypto development and early adopters have not been wasted. As a result of that money spent, We have a functional alternate economy world wide.  Infrastructure has a price. It makes no sense to cry and regret paying those who created it for their efforts. 

If you want to catch a real ponzi scheme before it eats you … then look carefully at the nature of investments.  If someone says they’re skimming market winnings and trade percentages for you.   Chances are high that it’s a ponzi scheme.  If they’re telling you the nigerian prince story, and they just need some of your money to transfer billions of theirs to your nation, then it’s a ponzi scheme at best.  Be very ware of any investments that you don’t have super intimate knowledge or control over.  The money game is extremely ravenous, and it’s very common that you’ll end up with nothing but excuses while the attorneys picked up what remained of the booty. 

2: It’s a bubble!!   Run Chicken little!!!!!
Cryptocurrency in general is not “a bubble”.  There is a massive army of developers, and more system falling into place every day.  It’s an open system, so anyone can get involved in building it like crazy.  What crypto is is “bubbly” This is caused by uncertainty in their actual value.. This means that it’s easy for unwary investors to buy at the wrong time and wind up taking damage .. particularly if they then shortly thereafter sell at the wrong time.   Market fluctuations can make you rich or  make you poor, so it’s important to learn how to play the game before getting involved.  This document will help some people hopefully to do just that. 


3:  It’s too centralized!!!!  Run  chicken Little!!!!
All of the cryptos of any potency that I know of, have a degree of aristocracy.   But then, all financial systems of note that I know of have the same issue.  Cryptos are designed to be decentralized, but this design intent is only partially fulfilled.  Whales, special mega-nodes like EOS nodes, Mining groups,  etc. cause centralization.   Division into many alt-coins then re-decentralizes the system.  The end result is actually on the large scale, quite decentralized, but still with a lot of bumps of centralization that seem to be impossible to iron out. 



4:  Cryptos are using too much power!!!   
Temporarily a problem. Over time, mining/staking algs that use less power will tend to dominate because of this problem.   Staking algs are likely to dominate in the future because not only do they solve the power problem, but they solve the problem of mining sharks that might bounce from crypto to crypto administrating 51% attacks because of the fact that many cryptos can be mined with the same algs, and therefore the same hardware.  


5:  The fees are too high!!!  Boo hoo hoo!!!
Maybe they are, maybe they aren’t.  Currently, it’s possible to exchange cryptos for various percentages in fees.  Depending on what you’re after, how hard you look, etc.  Exchanging in an actual market tends to have smaller fees than exchanging in a user simple exchange.  Gemini is currently quoted as having relatively low fees.  1% exchange rate or lower should be achievable.  Transfer fees are usually negligible, but this failed while BTC was overloaded with traffic.  Since then, BTC has gone up drastically in bandwidth. However, we still expect it to overload at the next speculation surge.   1% exchange fee and very small transfer fee combined are less than a common 3% credit card fee. But more interestingly, crypto multisig/escrow markets like openbazaar (openbazaar.org) are popping up that will be able to mostly eliminate ebay/amazon type listing fees without giving up consumer protection.  The mechanism for this is the ability to use multisig features of cryptos (sort of unavailable for fiat) to set up escrow agents.  Those agents will be able to work doing escrow in undeveloped nations, resulting in near zero listing and user protection costs.  Ebay/Amazon tend to take up to and over 20% of item costs . Crypto markets are able to offer roughly 10% value back to both purchaser and seller.  This type of crypto market is popping up in large numbers.  Their use is still low because the population percentage using cryptos is low.  As that population percentage rises, and as the market tech improves, they are expected to eventually become very attractive options for purchasing/selling.  

If you purchase and sell with proper thinking, the fees will be the least of your concerns.  Cryptos can double, 10x, even 100x before you sell/spend them.   However, there will only likely be one more really powerful price rise before the game slows down quite a bit. 

Summary:  fees may or may not be higher than the fees you are already paying depending on how you play the game.  In the future, we expect the fee costs to be quite a bit lower in general, than what people are spending now. Pay much more attention to the market fluctuation issues than the fees. 



6:  There are tax problems!!!  Run Chicken Little!!!!!
This depends on how you play the game.  In the U.S. long term cap. Gains for taxpayers may be quite a bit higher than most crypto users will enjoy before there is actually any tax ($37000 year .. ) Short term capital gains are more of a concern, so it’s better if a taxpayer can plan to avoid spendinge/exchanging for at least a year after purchasing.  Clearly if you spend immediately, then there is no capital gain concern.   This all adds significance to careful timing regarding crypto-currency events.  Careful examination of timing for crypto purchases is crucial for success. 



7:  There is no inherent value!!! Run Chicken Little!!!!!
Libertarian types lost the economics war.  It’s time for them to accept that they have been fed a load of crap, and that’s why they lost.  For starters, predictability is a weakness on the market, so if a giant bunch of libertarians behave predictably, then they’re basically opening themselves to damage.  Market value is primarily perception and only a little bit “truth”.   Does gold have intrinsic value?  Yeah, but if all of the gold were set onto the market to be used intrinsically, the price would plummet through the floor.  Gold is primarily used for banks to impress libertarian types with their holdings and power. That’s its primary intrinsic value.  .. To shit libertarian types into admitting the superiority of banks.   The proper response of libertarian types is to stop slobbering over gold and learn to play diamond shit, where you begin to regard and project the value of assets as much or more according to who owns them than what they are.  Bankers and market gamers won the market game, and their approach towards value is not to assign intrinsic value to things, but to perpetually assert that if it’s theirs, it’s diamonds, but if its yours, its shit.  Catch a hint.  Markets are manipulated and people robbed by manipulations of perception of value… and by stealing things.  In 1933, gold bouillon was robbed from the public in order to pay a fake debt.  The U.S. should have been paid for “saving Europe from Hitler” not enslaved.   The U.S. saved the bankers empire from Hitler.  They should have sent a giant f’n bill for that.  But the people were lied to, and responsibility for saving banking empire was pinned upon the idiots who died for it rather than the ones who benefited.  This is how money systems really work.  The people who are positioned to somehow dictate how things are calculated are the ones who come out ahead …  not the ones who hide gold in the local safe deposit boxes until gov. robs it.  Money and its value are a perpetual argument, basket of lies and cheating,  and war.  Accept it and face up to it.  Learn not to be cheated.  Good friend of mine was so sold on silver and so anti-fiat that he put over $2M into a silver ponzi scheme and was robbed.  I suggested that same friend purchase BTC when it was $5/coin …..  he didn’t … ya just can’t fix stupid.  That is one of the primary issues that we are going to have to confront in the coming decades as the world decides to whom the future belongs. 

As it goes, many cryptos do in fact have “intrinsic value”  these cryptos are crypto-locked with various data services that have inherent value.   Furthermore, it’s crucial to understand that the ability to trade with others is in and of its self an intrinsic value, and cryptos outperform all other options in many dimensions in this regard. 




8:  You can’t really buy anything with cryptos .. They’re fake…  Run chicken Little!!!
uuuuh …   this assertion is just flat out, blatantly wrong.  It’s utter shit, and if you believe it, you’re a fool. You can buy all kinds of shit on the market with cryptos. Try using egifter together with a whole host of online stores, even Amazon, try newegg,  tigerdirect, .. there are more major online stores,  and tons of great airline options.  However, don’t expect to purchase cars, groceries, or real estate, or highly specialized items with crypto. Newegg only sells their own stuff for crypto, not stuff that others are marketing there.   If you pay attention, you can get most common consumer items online with crypto.  Just plan yourself so that you understand that you’re still going to need to use fiat quite a bit .. at least for now.  The idea is that as adoption for cryptos grows, more and more economic loops will be closed such that Fiat is not as crucial as it is now. 

Currently, support for bitcoin in purchasing is very strong. Bitcoin is for that reason still very dominant in the market.  Simultaneously, support for alt coins is growing and can be expected to continue to grow. 


9:  There’s not enough bandwidth for global economy!!!   Run Chicken Little!!!!
This is actually blatantly false.  Between bitcoin and the assorted alt coins … there is actually plenty of bandwidth available to run a global economy right now.  This might sound scary, cause people would have to keep track of multiple currencies for this to work, but in reality, this problem has been solved for you. There are already multi-coin wallets that can keep track of 50 to 100 currencies or more almost as easily as they keep track of one.


10:  Banks own the system, so it’s not helping!!!!
It was inevitable that banks and Walstreet would get involved.  Banks own a lot of the markets, Walstreet owns a lot of the investment funds. .. Come on, did you really think the money mongers were going to stand there and watch their fortunes disappear?   Fact is that while their involvement is concerning, it also helps to a degree to stabilize the system.  They will be less likely to attack assetts politically that they are involved with.  Do banks/walstreet own the coins?   Eeeeh … I doubt they own more than 20% of them at this time.  Still, by far, the owners of crypto are crypto investors, and early adopters.   

More importantly, this whole idea is focusing on the wrong issue.  I told the PIVX group once … OK, satanist bankers  got on the bus .. but open systems community is still driving the bus … so drive the bus to Prometheusville where Satan will seriously eye his former “prometheus” role as very tempting to assume.  In fact, in Prometheusville, prometheus will have the economic advantage over Satan, so it will be in his best interest to convert.  This is part of the philosophy of “pivmetheus” consensus model. 

The  primary issue of public money systems is not really who is running them, but what the dynamic is. If cryptos are operating a more healthy dynamic, then it doesn’t matter much if what used to be shit bags is running it. One of the primary advantages of cryptos is actually not cryptos, but the fact that they are forcing competition onto what used to be a monopolistic money system. 








11: Banks/Governments will never allow cryptos to become powerful!!!  Run Chicken Little!!!!
Governments and banks are all positioned and powered differently. Cryptos are not really an attack on government, but an attack on banking power, which governments have been allowing. Elites are not monolithically unified, and many of them have already bought heavily into cryptos.  



12:  You still have to use fiat, so it’s all useless!!  It’s hopeless, just forget it and go back to the banks, cause my name is Damon!!  Crypto is a well protected child. You don’t ask babies to function like adults. Just give it time, it will function like an adult when it gets there.  The ties to and necessity of fiat will diminish with time.  Even decentralized exchanges have been/ will be erected such that for crypto to crypto exchange, no middle man will be required.  Efficiency and independence in the crypto-sphere is going to do nothing but rise.  However, it’s IMO unrealistic to ever expect or even want complete independence. 



13: Cryptos will never destroy the banks, so what’s the use????
So far, cryptos haven’t been designed to destroy banks, but to outperform banks in a large number of niches so that banks have competition imposed upon them.  Competition is actually a primary issue. You don’t really need to destroy banks, just force them to operate at lower overhead costs.  Nevertheless, I am well aware of ways in which the crypto community could expand beyond its original premise, and compete more directly with banks.  Just how this will play out in the future is difficult to predict. 

14: There is no real anonymity!!!
uuuuh … no, this is bullshit … if anonymity is what you are after, you can have it.  There are multiple routes for accomplishing that.  Just do your homework.  Agreed however, without some effort on your side, genuine anonymity will not happen. 


15:  There’s back doors!!!
uuuuuuh …  the fundamental strategy for various cryptography strategies is that there is no back door.  The fundamental strategy for others is that there are back doors.  Cryptos were designed and have been examined by large numbers of cryptographers.  They would know and would have expressed if there are back doors. Even quantum computing has been expressed as being a highly unlikely back door because of the extremely difficult logistics of wide-bit serial computations with qubits that are by definition … less than a bit of information, therefore in requirement of large numbers of parallel qubits in order to guarantee integrity of long serial quantum computations. … and no yet known means of actually paralleling quibits.  Occasionally, back doors are discovered for hash algs. Etc.  that were unexpected.  This has not been the case for cryptos in general, though a small number of (usually small, but occasionally large) breeches of security have been successful.   Being frightened of back doors is basically Chicken Little’s job.   Run … chicken Little!!!!!   Even in the case of a back door being discovered, a crypto has the option of responding by truncating the chain, and inserting a new algorithm.   



16:  It would be easy to destroy cryptos for govs and banks!!!
Technically, yes, especially if all govs ganged up on cryptos simultaneously.   But governments are not so easy to predict as simply assuming that they are all anti-crypto or all united.  The primary leverage of cryptos on this turf is that many governments are crypto-friendly. State governments for example .. that don’t run with the Federal Reserve have little to lose and plenty to gain from the rise of cryptos.  Several nations have already sided with cryptos, including Germany, Japan, Philippines and more.  In such nations, cryptos enjoy little to no taxes, and are even viewed as legitimate currencies.   Nations that are able to successfully use cryptos are raising the bar in global economics, and that is a competitive market. Nations that fall behind or resist cryptos will slowly discover that they are losing position in the crucial international currency contest.  They already know this, and so most nations that at some time had banned cryptocurrencies have been forced to admit that it is not in their interest to do that.  The open systems community has created genuine options, and simply disregarding and attacking that would basically be stupid for nations.  Banks may have more interest in holding back cryptos than governments, but banks don’t wield all of the power.  Banks have repeatedly been forced to hold accounts open for crypto exchanges etc in the name of anti-monopoly laws.  Trust is a valuable asset.  Diffuse trust provided by cryptocurrencies is a valuable asset.  Destruction of that trust is a destruction of value.   The politics of cryptocurrencies have basically made them unassailable by much more than regulation, limited hacking,  and market gaming.  You can pretty much bet your ass that cryptos will be around for a long time.  … 

17:  They’re gonna buy it all up!!! There’ll be nothing left for the public to trade with!!! Run Chicken Little!!!
Don’t underestimate the intelligence of cryptocurrencies.  This problem is well accounted for at the onset. It doesn’t matter how much crypto banks or governments or whoever buys.  Unlike gold, silver, etc. cryptos are effectively infinitely divisible.  If 100 BTC remain on the market, bitcoin could be made to still serve the whole planet.  Dividing gold/silver down into smaller pieces begins to become ridiculous, but it’s completely not an issue for cryptos. 

18: Banks and the government set cryptos into motion!   Run Chicken Little!!!
uuuuuuh … it would be completely retarded to set a rapidly mutating virus loose on their own turf. Guardian types are in love with stability, not technical challenge.  This technology has shattered into a thousand pieces, each with its own attempt at constructing a future.  There’s no straight forward way to control and contain all of that.  It’s not a case of anyone at all in control. It’s a case of the cat out of the bag. 





### Next, I am going to bring forward some of the real problems with cryptocurrencies

1:  The biggest problem with cryptos is market gaming.  There is a host of tricks out in play that have been used to attack the wealth of unsuspecting investors.  Most of these tricks amount to .. well, basically,  .. mind tricks.   The fundamental single strategy in market gaming is to always convince the public of the wrong value for an asset, then buy or sell  in order to gain the difference.  Later on, the values correct, and buyers/sellers feel like idiots who fell for a scam.  But it was not necessarily a scam (though that is also possible) ..  what is happening is that non New Yorkers are suddenly being confronted with the problematics of markets, which they have no experience with in the past.   This is not a reflection on cryptocurrencies.  Rather, it is the exposure of the means by which Walstreet has managed to rob the public of massive amounts of wealth invisibly, behind closed doors, for a very long time.  Finally, market gamers and cheaters have come out in the open for scrutiny by the general public .. albeit, to rob the public, but simultaneously to reveal their shit-baggery. 

Market gaming tricks:  


    • Media hype:   media drama is used to intentionally manipulate the value of assets. It works like this … someone figures out in advance what is pretty likely some dramatic event .. or they plan it.  Then they buy/sell to appropriately position themselves, then the event occurs, then they hype the hell out of it in order to maximize the price impact of the event.  Then they buy/sell to cache in on the price shift.   The media hype is almost always too late to respond to equitably for the public because the market is an information game.  To win it, you need to know things before the rest of the market does.  It’s unwise to purchase anything that is being advertised because as soon as the advertisement goes down, so will the price.   The catastrophe of limited BTC bandwidth was an example of this problem.  Hypesters bought up  alt coins, then hyped, then dumped, then BTC/BCH divided, the bandwidth problem was over, and the hypesters came out victorious.  .. This is basically the “diamond shit” strategy. 

    • Pump and dump:  Best opportunity for pump and dump is when an asset is first created. Original holders of an asset release only a little to the market, driving up the price.  When it appears that the price will no longer rise, those people begin to dump.  I have watched very dramatic dumps where nearly the entire buyers board was eviscerated several times over within minutes.  To protect from this kind of problem, it’s crucial to be wary of brand new assets, or assets that recently were added to a major exchange.  It’s wise to have a strong idea of how centralized an asset is before purchasing.  Assets that are strongly owned by just a few are getting ready for dump.  Market gamers will sometimes buy up large amounts of an asset before it makes it to any major market, then dump it all when a new market drives the price up. 

    • Market cheats:  Market hacks have a number of tricks that make it difficult to win the market game.  For example … one might load up the buyers board with a pile of value … way down low where no one will ever transact .. in order to convince the public that something is a hot item.  Buy and sell walls where massive asset clumps are strategically placed on the boards in order to manipulate prices without actually buying/selling are a standard trick.  Another common trick for doing this is the insertion of phony bids onto market boards.  Tiny bids that are effectively just place holders.  So, some market whale may set up a system of a small pair of  buy/sell walls, and insulate the price with the appearance of legitimacy by inserting miniscule place-holder bids onto the board.  When the whale pulls or sells the buy/sell walls, the price is floating in space, and those who weren’t watching, can be forced to buy/sell at 10% loss or so. 
    • Pump groups: pump groups are often predatory to their own members.  They’ll take advantage of newbies by telling them to hold their assets while the price is high while the group organizers sell … thereby tricking noobs into buying high and holding.   Pump groups may also act in unison as whales to manipulate prices. 
    • Gambling bots make quick statistical calculations for buy and sell positions and wait for real people to make crappy deals. Turning every purchase into a likely loss. Gambling bots may also work to hold a rise/fall in price hold pretty straight to a flat line, therefore eliminating most hints as to the future of an asset from the market curve while they use calculations from their buys/sales to come to careful, mathematically calculated shifts in behavior based on information that is not readily visible to common investors. 



Consensus model problems:
Cryptocurrencies want to be the solution to a form of aristocracy really, but their consensus models are still aristocratic. The large numbers of them operating are currently holding aristocracy collectively at bay, but market history indicates that the number of cryptos in common use will probably boil down to a smaller number, and aristocracy will become a greater problem.   The problem here is that the open systems community has not yet learned to operate a system without aristocracy because that’s the history they come from.  This fundamental problem was solved on paper by the consensus model named “pivmetheus”.  Efforts are under way to generate a consensus model which is both effective, and aristocracy resistant. 

Division:
Cryptos keep dividing up and creating more and more alt coins.  Inevitably, many of these alt coins die and disintegrate, but not before causing damage to investors.  Division is both necessary and a curse in crypto-sphere.  It will be required in order to provide adequate bandwidth for world markets. Some coins try to disagree with this like EOS.  These coins are not true cryptos in spirit because they operate using nodes that are very expensive to build.  The general public will not be able to take part in mining/staking, etc. for those coins, and they will be more susceptible to physical attack because of the small numbers of nodes.  They overcome bandwidth limits with just single coins/chains, but they are too much like the old aristocracies to put our faith in.  Single, divided chains is what we want, so that individuals in their homes can help run the systems.  This means that there is extra risk in following new coins or new divisions of coins.  The solution may be simply to avoid brand new coins or coins before, during, or after recent divisions.  If you think you know what is going to happen because of a division, then it’s your call to take up the added risk.  

Fraud: There is a reasonable percentage of fraudulent assets.  Nephew of mine was all excited about “bitconnect”.  He wanted to buy in to the next project done by the same coders.  I said … uuuuh … they’re moving on to another project now?  They’re clearly pump and dumpers.  You don’t want anything to do with them.  Soon thereafter, those coders dumped masses of bitconnect onto the market and the price collapsed.  The outcry was so great that government decided that bitconnect was a ponzi scheme and shut them down and came after them.  Investors need to be aware of market gaming and the nature of the asset they’re interested in before getting involved.  There should have been a red flag out on bitconnect because its initial devs were holding far too much of it.  As time flows, the community will be working on this kind of measure and indicators for safety in investment. They always have attacked and defeated their problems.  There are already sites up that are displaying this kind of information on cryptos, but we need to remember that crypto enthusiasts are new to money gaming, and it will take some time for them to fully catch on. 

Hype:
If you are reacting to advertisements, or speculative information, or news articles, then you are most likely being manipulated.  News always comes too late to react to something. If you and your friends can’t figure out a decent approximation of what is going to happen with reasonable certainty, following hype is often just falling into a trap.  People use media, news, and even chat groups to express ideas and drama that manipulates prices.  The investor needs to see past the hype, into the actual dynamic of the market.  This is the true challenge, and the investor who succeeds at that has earned his profits.  Accomplishing this can be everywhere from easy to hard.  The dynamic of alt coins can be really complicated and unpredictable.  The dynamic of major coins that have held position long term already tends to be more stable and predictable. 

Risk:
Older, stable, main runner coins tend to be lower risk. Especially if they are sporting great tech.  New er coins are high risk, high gain turf.  Any investments in newer coins probably needs to be watched like a hawk to avoid taking major losses.  There is a strong trend for investors to flock to bitcoin during troubled times, and move back out to alt coins during times of faith. This is because bitcoin represents security in limited supply while alt coins represent potential for both bandwidth and feature wealth. 

Thought example:  Cardano is a very interesting coin sporting likely the most potent attitude towards crypto tech development.  This might suggest that it will hold a strong position near the leadership in crypto-land.  However, Cardano is relatively new.  Its value peaked in January 2018 during a cycle of crypto collapse, because of its new position rather than Dec. 2017 when most cryptos peaked.  This indicates that many initial cardano owners likely decided to hold and wait for the next speculation wave before “dumping”.  However, that’s quite a wait, so that dynamic should not be completely dominant in Cardano’s position.  During the coming speculation wave, we expect most alt coins to rise more dramatically than BTC during the rise.  Therefore, we expect Cardano to perform in that pattern. However, we expect it to perform slightly less well than older high profile coins that already went through complete, initial pump/dump cycles.  

Interest tends to arrive in giant speculator waves, each one larger than the last by a factor of ten or so.  If we figure that positive cryptocurrencies and negative fiat  are going to share the world roughly equally (a good guess) Then, the standard adoption s-curve would indicate that positive cryptos, rising to a total duty of 20T to 50T  have a single major speculator wave left before the dynamic has to smooth out and start to play new games.  Probably a second, smaller order of magnitude gain speculator wave will also arrive later.  At roughly 10 trillion total market cap, the community activity will be crazy intense, and new systems will be rising at break-neck speed.  

Old tech coins tend to fizzle out and die.  Some of the newer ones were born with consensus models, and they have little trouble upgrading.  Their tech will likely not quickly age, and they are less likely to divide because they can simply upgrade. 


And some crucial, but generalized hints about how to interact with the markets. 

Timing:
As noted earlier, it’s more important when we buy/sell than what. Any brand new coin is for example, very dangerous for purchase, as brand new coins have a massive history of initial pump and dump. If the coin hasn’t been out and on major markets for at least 6-8 months, the danger is generally not worth potential gains.  On the other hand, if it’s a brand new coin that hasn’t been on any major markets, this is a somewhat safer condition, since coins tend to be low priced when only positioned on small markets. 

Purchase while an asset is falling can be quite risky. “Falling knives” is a term used in this case.  Falling prices can fall further.  Also remember that pump/dumpers are strategically choosing when to dump. Falling prices are basically serious gambles. This causes investors to run, but eventually what tends to happen is some investors call bull shit because prices fell ridiculously low.  They begin to purchase, and falls can result in rapid and intense rebounds.  Those rebounds often peter out and revert to falling again, (bull trap), but if the prices are genuinely, too low, then they tend to hold and often continue to rise. 

It’s crucial to examine the history of cryptos in order to have an idea of what to expect, because the ability to see the future is everything, and the future tends to be a repeat of the past. Generically, cryptos rise until they bang their head on something, and then collapse again.  2011, they were hacked, and exchanges were shut down.   2013, Mt. Gox was hacked.  2017, regulation and Tax became a sudden problem.   What will they bang their heads on next?  My guess is that there will be a second wave of regulation and government involvement. 


Panic:
If your emotions get the best of you and you panic-buy … you may be wise to realize that the next likely reaction is that when it starts to drop, you panic sell.   A panic buy followed by a panic sell is where you take a guaranteed loss.  What investors need is a strong idea of where coins are headed, so that they don’t need to panic.  Panic is the enemy.  It’s very unwise to dive onto especially a new asset that you haven’t carefully scoped out in advance using strong knowledge of the game.  You might see it rising and panic buy to cache in on the rise just before it collapses. .. Yes, this happens a lot.  Noobs have untrained reactions to markets, and while the data is moving rapidly, their minds are moving slowly.  Best solution to this is to practice the markets for a while before getting deeply involved. Practice with small amounts, or with imaginary amounts.  The game has no mercy, and loves to eat people. Simultaneously, it has no problem rewarding them as well.  Your individual performance is what makes the difference. 




### And some of the appropriate, large scale, best future options for cryptos. 

Unification:  Besides multi-coin wallets which make it easy to use a lot of leading cryptos without becoming confused and overburdened with software, more complex schemes are arising that will be able to take advantage of each cryptocurrencies special talents in the construction of complex transaction models. 



* Improved Consensus: Proof of stake and other consensus models have already shrunk the cost and energy use of securing chains.  Many coins sport decision making models for their own communities that include voting rights for users.  IMO, pivmetheus is the most advanced such model, but is not yet in use. 

* Side-chains: Crypto bandwidth can be made available by developing systems that successfully interrelate multiple chains.  Such strategies have already been constructed. 

* AI:  Chains are showing up that use AI for prediction markets, insurance and such. 

* Computing:  Chains exist that sell decentralized cloud and supercomputing resources. 

* Data storage:  Chains are showing up that manage decentralized, encrypted data storage and document storage/verification. 

* Zero Knowledge Proofs:  These seem to be the favorite choice for hard anonymity solutions

* DAG:  Directed Acyclic graphs are being tested as an alternative for block chains.

* Smart contracts:  digital contracts that self-activate. 

* Identity:  Identity models are being developed that offer maximum anonymity and control of ones own identity data.  These models can not be hi-jacked by hacking databases or such as current identity databases can. 

* Oracles:  Digital truth tellers regarding any subject matter that comply with security definitions. 

* Dex:  decentralized exchanges create 1:1 exchange relationships that use no middle men. 

* ADCF:  auto distribution crowd funding … implemented by Einsteinium

* Micro-transactions:  These may be accomplished by various contracting and re-contracting options. Large numbers of tiny payments may enable types of business that were never possible. 

* Multisignature transactions:  Create group security features by requiring multiple digital signatures for transactions. 

* Decentralized markets:  Such as Open Bazaar will enable nearly middle-manless purchases without sacrificing security by means of multisignature escrow accounts. As these rise, we expect circulation gaps in the crypto-economy to begin to close in.
